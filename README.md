# Fetch Rewards Mobile Application
This android application was made for an exercise assigned by Fetch Rewards for a Mobile Engineer Internship position. The application retrieves data in the JSON format and displays it within a list. Each item is then grouped together by their list id. Each grouping can be expanded upon or collapsed by either clicking the little arrow icon or by long pressing on the list id text view.  This makes scrolling through each list much easier. Within each list item is displayed with their item id and item name. Each list is also sorted by their items name.
